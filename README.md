making life easier
Contribute to the repo do work faster and also cover back log
just keep a few things in mind:

- Don't add redundant code, it should work and get the job done
- Add appropriate .gitignores (eg: ignore a.out)
- Use Proper convention so that the code is easy to understand
- Test your snippets before adding and include a readme on how to use it

That's all, i hope we continue to help each other and get through our remaining years here with relative ease.
